Gamu-Dama is a Retro-Inspired Beat-em Up Arcade game that a fellow USC student, Marcus Gordon and I had developed. 
This game was primarily developed for our CTIN-489 class, in this class, it is a requirement for students to get into pairs and work with each other to create a game in the game engine, Unity. After the Alpha Build is completed, we then collaborated with students from the University of Berkley, these students would help produce the music for our game. The purpose is to gain experience in collaborating with others in relation to Game Development. 

My roles in Gamu-Dama were the following: 
     - Games Designer
     - Pixel Artist & Animator 
     - Sound Designer 
     - QA Testing 

Games Designer: 

TBA

Pixel Artist & Animator 

I was in charge of designing and animating the sprites of the main character, Rikishi and the villains such as the Skeletons: Green and Purple, the Ink Squid, Yeti and non-enemy characters such as the Bear. Not only did I do the character but also I played a role in creating the moveset for Rikishi, inspired by our previous draw ups for the game which had a heavy emphasis on candy, we decided Rikishi's main ball form should be inspired by the Konpeito. In addition to doing these designs, I responsible for the animations too. All of the art and animation was done in the online software, Piskel. 

Sound Designer: 

While most of the sound design had been done by teammates from Berkley, I had created the sound effect of Rikishi's Konpeito colliding with surfaces. This was done in the program, LMMS where I had utilized low octave chord of notes which closely resembled to that of a heavy object making contact with a hard surface. Then I had edited the reverb. 

QA Testing:

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
