Welcome. My name Oluwatoayomi Oretofunmi Onajobi, though I go by Toayo. I am a Senior at the University of Southern California, pursuing a degree in Computer Science Games. I'm interested in pursuing a career in Games Design as well as Software Engineering.  

I have experience in developing programs and software in both C++ and Java. In addition to my coding background, I also have dabbled into design, Maya and Asperite being my software of choices when related to 3D Modelling and Pixel Art. 

Outside of college, I enjoy drawing digitally, collecting DC comics and I often participate in tournaments for the video game, Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.
